\subsection{Functional Requirements List}
The following table summarizes the functional requirements of the Tutor Support System. Requirements are grouped into thematic categories to ensure clarity and traceability.\\

\textbf{Prioritization Method}: In this project, we applied the MoSCoW prioritization technique to classify functional requirements. This method categorizes requirements into four levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Must: Essential for the system to function; without them, the system fails to meet its objectives.
    \item Should: Important but not vital; the system can still operate without them in the first release.
    \item Could: Desirable enhancements that improve usability or efficiency if time/resources allow.
    \item Won’t (this time): Explicitly excluded from the current scope, possibly considered for future releases.
\end{itemize}

This approach ensures clarity in requirement importance and helps manage project scope effectively.

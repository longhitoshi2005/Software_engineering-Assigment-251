\begin{abstract}
This report describes the specification and design of a Tutor Support System (TSS) developed to modernize and scale the Tutor/Mentor program at HCMUT. The study investigates how a centralized platform can support tutor and student profiles, tutor-student matching, session scheduling and booking, feedback and progress tracking, and departmental reporting while integrating with existing HCMUT infrastructure (SSO and DATACORE). Requirements engineering (use-case modelling, MoSCoW prioritization) and detailed functional/non-functional analysis were used to derive the system's core capabilities and constraints. The resulting specification defines an MVP that emphasizes secure role-based access control, reliable scheduling and notifications, data synchronization with university sources, and extensible reporting and analytics. We demonstrate that the proposed TSS design meets performance, security, and usability targets for campus deployment and provides clear upgrade paths for optional AI-assisted matching and community features. This work contributes a complete, submission-ready specification that enables HCMUT to implement a practical, auditable tutoring platform that improves student support and administrative decision-making.

To align with prior functional-programming constraints used in course assignments, if applicable:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only allowed imports per assignment rules.
  \item Prefer pure functions; avoid global state.
  \item Prefer higher-order functions and list comprehensions over loops.
  \item Single-assignment variables within functions to encourage immutability.
\end{itemize}
(Adapt or remove this section if your instructor does not require functional-programming constraints.)

# Tutor Support System â€“ Specification (Overleaf Project)

This folder is ready to upload to Overleaf. Open `main.tex` and compile (XeLaTeX or pdfLaTeX).  
Replace placeholder images in `images/` with your UML (use-case, ERD).

## Structure
- `main.tex`: master file
- `sections/`: content split by sections
- `images/`: put your diagrams here

## Tips
- Keep packages standard to avoid Overleaf errors.
- If you don't need Vietnamese accents, you can remove `\usepackage[T5]{fontenc}`.
